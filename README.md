# Fake News Detection Using a Language Model

This project presents a solution using a Language Model for the detection of fake news in Spanish. The system is composed of two main phases:

1.  **Model Training:** A Python script was created that unifies multiple news corpora in Spanish, calibrates hyperparameters, and trains a language model with a GPU and `DistilBERT` for text classification.
2.  **Web Analysis Application:** A web application built with Flask and Docker that allows a user to enter the URL of a news article for the trained model to analyze and issue a real-time verdict.

## Project Description

The objective of this research is to apply Natural Language Processing (NLP) and deep learning techniques to build a tool capable of discerning between real and fake news. The process includes data collection and unification, fine-tuning of a pre-trained Transformer model, and the implementation of an interactive web application for practical use.

## System Architecture

The system consists of three main components:
- **Web Interface (Flask):** Handles user requests and displays results
- **Text Processor:** Extracts and preprocesses text from news URLs
- **Classification Model (DistilBERT):** Analyzes the text and predicts authenticity

The diagram above illustrates the complete flow from when a user submits a URL until they receive the classification result, showing the interaction between all system components.

## Features

* **Corpus Unification:** Consolidates multiple news datasets in Spanish into a single clean and standardized corpus.
* **Multilingual Model:** Uses `distilbert-base-multilingual-cased`, a powerful and efficient model capable of understanding multiple languages.
* **Hyperparameter Calibration:** Employs `KerasTuner` to find the optimal model configuration, maximizing its performance.
* **Robust Evaluation:** Splits the data into training (80%), validation (10%), and testing (10%) sets for an unbiased evaluation of the model.
* **Complete Metrics:** Generates a detailed report with Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score.
* **Results Visualization:** Creates learning curve graphs and a confusion matrix for a visual analysis of performance.
* **Interactive Web Application:** A simple web interface where you can paste a URL to get an instant analysis.
* **Containerization with Docker:** The entire project is dockerized, ensuring easy and reproducible execution on any system.
